We are removing any existing table with the name we are going to push i.e. airbnb_ny_2019_raw and airbnb_ny_2019_processed_stage.
Now we push the raw csv data to airbnb_ny_2019_raw table in SQL.

Now we transform the data, 
1) Normalize the data
  -> Host Name is repeating for host id we can create a dimension table to reduce repetetion and perform join to view data when needed, we will remove host_name column from here
  -> Neighbourhood_group is repeating, we can create dimension table to reduce the repetetion, we will remove neighbourhood_group from here
  -> calculated_host_listings_count doesnt need to be stored as this can be calculated using the existing data, GROUP BY host_id to find

2) Handle the missing values with default values
  -> reviews_per_month - 0.0
  -> last_review - 1990-01-01

3) Calculated Metrics
  -> Average price per neighbourhood
  -> Average price per neighbouhood_group
  -> Average price based on room_type
  -> Number of listing per neighbourhood

Load the transformed data to final table now: 
We are using a stage table to eliminate chance of failure, incase there is failure we have the old data.
